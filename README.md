# SurvivalGame
Functionality of each script is explained as below: 
AI_Movement.cs :- This script controls AI movement in Unity using a NavMeshAgent and animations. The AI randomly chooses a direction (forward, left, right, or backward) to walk for a set duration, then stops and waits before choosing a new direction, with animations toggling between running and idle states.
Animal.cs :- This script manages an animal's health, damage, and death in Unity. It tracks player proximity, updates a health bar UI, triggers animations for taking damage or dying, and plays a death sound before destroying the animal object when its health reaches zero.
BookPanelHandler.cs- This script hides a book panel UI element and resumes the game when the spacebar is pressed, by deactivating the panel and setting the time scale back to 1 (normal speed).
BookTrigger.cs- This script triggers a quest update when the player enters a collider tagged as "Player" and the current quest stage is "FindBook." It updates the quest stage to "ReadBook" using the QuestManager.
CampfireTrigger.cs- This script updates the quest stage to "FindMansion" when the player enters the trigger area, but only if the current quest stage is "FindCampfire." It uses the QuestManager to handle the quest progression.
DayNightCycle.cs- This script simulates a day-night cycle in Unity by adjusting a skybox material's blend value over time. It tracks the current time, allows for time scaling, and provides methods to check if it's nighttime, get the current time, or convert the time to a 24-hour format.
EndPanel.cs- This script provides functionality for an end panel in Unity, allowing the player to either load the main menu scene ("Menu") or quit the game entirely. It resets the time scale to normal before loading the menu and logs a message when quitting the game.
EndSceneManager.cs- This script displays the player's survival time and best time on the end scene using TextMeshProUGUI elements. It retrieves the times from PlayerPrefs, formats them into a "MM:SS " string, and updates the UI text accordingly.
EnemyAi.cs- This script controls an enemy AI in Unity using NavMesh for navigation. The enemy patrols randomly within a defined range, chases the player when within sight, and attacks by shooting projectiles when in attack range. It also handles taking damage, health management, and visual debugging for sight and attack ranges.
EquipSystem.cs- This script manages tool equipping in Unity. It allows the player to equip a tool (e.g., an axe) by instantiating the corresponding prefab from the Resources/Tools folder, updating the tool's damage value, and tracking whether an axe is equipped. It also handles destroying previously equipped tools.
FoodItem.cs- This script defines a food item in Unity, specifying its name (e.g., "Green Apple") and the amount of hunger it restores when consumed (e.g., 20). It serves as a simple data container for food-related properties.
Health.cs- This script manages a character's health in Unity. It initializes the health to a maximum value, updates a health bar UI when damage is taken, and allows testing damage input (e.g., pressing the spacebar reduces health by 20). The health bar is updated using the HealthBarScript.
HealthBarScript.cs- This script controls a health bar UI element using a Slider. It sets the maximum health value and updates the slider's value to reflect the current health, providing a visual representation of health changes in the game.
HungerBar:- This script manages a hunger bar UI element using a Slider. It sets the maximum hunger value and updates the slider's value to reflect the current hunger level, providing a visual representation of hunger changes in the game.
InventoryManager.cs- This script manages an inventory system in Unity. It allows adding, removing, and displaying items in the inventory UI, with functionality to interact with items (e.g., consume food, equip tools, open books, or radios). The inventory can be toggled open/closed with a key press (e.g., "B"), and it handles UI visibility, cursor state, and player movement during inventory interactions.
Item.cs- This script defines an Item class as a ScriptableObject in Unity, allowing for the creation of customizable inventory items. Each item has properties like ID, name, icon, stackability, type (e.g., Food, Tool, Book, Radio), and additional attributes such as value or damage. It is used to create and manage item assets in the game.
ItemController.cs- This script serves as a simple controller for an item in Unity. It holds a reference to an Item object (likely defined as a ScriptableObject), allowing the game object to represent and interact with the item's data (e.g., name, icon, type) in the game world.
ItemPickup.cs- This script allows the player to pick up an item when they are within range and press the "E" key. It checks for player proximity using a trigger collider, adds the item to the inventory via the InventoryManager, and destroys the item object in the scene after pickup.
Leaderboard.cs- This script manages a leaderboard system in Unity. It tracks the player's survival time, updates the best time if the current survival time is higher, and displays both times in a formatted "MM:SS " string on the UI. It also handles saving and loading times using PlayerPrefs, and can pause the game and show/hide the leaderboard panel when the game ends.
