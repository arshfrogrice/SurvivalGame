# SurvivalGame
Functionality of each script is explained as below: 
AI_Movement.cs :- This script controls AI movement in Unity using a NavMeshAgent and animations. The AI randomly chooses a direction (forward, left, right, or backward) to walk for a set duration, then stops and waits before choosing a new direction, with animations toggling between running and idle states.
