# SurvivalGame
Functionality of each script is explained as below: 
AI_Movement.cs :- This script controls AI movement in Unity using a NavMeshAgent and animations. The AI randomly chooses a direction (forward, left, right, or backward) to walk for a set duration, then stops and waits before choosing a new direction, with animations toggling between running and idle states.
Animal.cs :- This script manages an animal's health, damage, and death in Unity. It tracks player proximity, updates a health bar UI, triggers animations for taking damage or dying, and plays a death sound before destroying the animal object when its health reaches zero.
BookPanelHandler.cs- This script hides a book panel UI element and resumes the game when the spacebar is pressed, by deactivating the panel and setting the time scale back to 1 (normal speed).
BookTrigger.cs- This script triggers a quest update when the player enters a collider tagged as "Player" and the current quest stage is "FindBook." It updates the quest stage to "ReadBook" using the QuestManager.
CampfireTrigger.cs- This script updates the quest stage to "FindMansion" when the player enters the trigger area, but only if the current quest stage is "FindCampfire." It uses the QuestManager to handle the quest progression.
DayNightCycle.cs- This script simulates a day-night cycle in Unity by adjusting a skybox material's blend value over time. It tracks the current time, allows for time scaling, and provides methods to check if it's nighttime, get the current time, or convert the time to a 24-hour format.
EndPanel.cs- This script provides functionality for an end panel in Unity, allowing the player to either load the main menu scene ("Menu") or quit the game entirely. It resets the time scale to normal before loading the menu and logs a message when quitting the game.
EndSceneManager.cs- This script displays the player's survival time and best time on the end scene using TextMeshProUGUI elements. It retrieves the times from PlayerPrefs, formats them into a "MM:SS " string, and updates the UI text accordingly.
EnemyAi.cs- This script controls an enemy AI in Unity using NavMesh for navigation. The enemy patrols randomly within a defined range, chases the player when within sight, and attacks by shooting projectiles when in attack range. It also handles taking damage, health management, and visual debugging for sight and attack ranges.
